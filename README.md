# Stress Master

A machine learning project, StressMaster, designed to assess and calculate different levels of stress using a Flask web app. The app collects user inputs through a structured questionnaire, analyzes stress-related factors, and provides insights on stress levels, ranging from low to high. The project aims to promote mental well-being by offering personalized stress management suggestions based on the calculated stress level.
